Xbox gift cards are delivered as 25-character digital codes, so you can email it, message it, or even write it in a card if you’re feeling old-school. The recipient just enters it on their Xbox or Microsoft account, and boom — it’s added to their balance.

And the best part? No expiration dates. They can save it for the next big sale or that new game they’ve been eyeing.

It’s Not Just for Gamers
Think Xbox gift cards are only for people playing Call of Duty or Minecraft? Think again. With that same balance, users can rent or buy movies, grab cool apps, or even shop on the Microsoft Store for PC.
